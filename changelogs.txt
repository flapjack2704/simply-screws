10/11/2022:
-Laid out foundations of codebase:
 > list str_screw_list to contain each screw and its stock
 > func file_to_string_list() to read the data file and write to str_screw_list

13/11/2022:
-Refactored file read loop in file_to_string_list() to a list comprehension
-Changed str_screw_list to lst_screws_list, now contains each screw listing as its own
  list of values inside the main list, e.g:
 [['brass', 'slot', '20', '35', '20', '10', '4.00'], ['brass', 'slot', '40', '40', '42', '40', '5.00']]
-Added file_to_list_of_lists() as part of above change
-Added constant list SCREW_COMBO_LIST (and its component lists) as a list all possible combos of screw, e.g:
 [['brass', 'slot', '20'], ['brass', 'slot', '40'], ['brass', 'slot', '60'], ['brass', 'star', '20']]
 Originally populated via nested for loops, now refactored and populated via list comprehension.
 This will be used in later code to match user input with the index of a screw combo.
 (Very easy to add new material, head-type or length to SCREW_COMBO_LIST in future)
-Added func show_screw_types(list) to fulfil Basic Feature #1

14/11/2022:
-Added total inventory summation output for show_screw_types(list)
-Added documentation for functions, will add more for all future functions
-Added show_total_units_of_length(list) to fulfil Basic Feature #2
-Added show_screw_types_with_length(length) to fulfil Basic Feature #3
 Uses show_screw_types(list) to print report for a shortened list
-Minor change to show_screw_types(list) to accomodate modularity; added an if statement at its end
-Added abstract functions increase_stock_level() and decrease_stock_level() to fulfil Advanced Feature #4
 Will add functionality after Advanced Features #5 and #6 are completed

18/11/2022:
-Added check_highest_stock_level() and apply_special_discount() to fulfil Advanced Feature #5
-Added special_discount_screw as a list to keep track of the special discounted screw combo

19/11/2022:
-Changed logic layout of check_highest_stock_level() better suit what was asked
-Added units_in_lengths_barchart() to fulfil Advanced Feature #6

20/11/2022:
-Minor readability improvements to check_highest_stock_level(); added input variable, more whitespace.
-Added check_stock_level() to fulfil Advanced Feature #4
-Added input_screw_combo() in case I need to reuse that particular code later.
-Added update_file() to fulfil Advanced Feature #4
-Removed increase_stock_level() and decrease_stock_level() as made redundant by above.
-Added process_sale() to ease readability of sales portion of update(file).
-Added input_integer() to force int input.
-Added list_to_string() to shape how strings are inputted to the data file.
-Changed check_highest_stock_level return type to N/A, now just updates the global special_discount_screw.
-Added "mm" to length strings because I didn't see that was how the screws were measured :D
